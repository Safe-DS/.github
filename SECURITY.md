# Security Policy

This document outlines how to **privately** report a security vulnerability in one of our repositories to give us time to fix the issue before disclosure (see [coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities)). We will investigate any report as soon as possible and take appropriate measures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

[Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) is enabled for all repositories of the `Safe-DS` organization. Follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab.
2. Click on the "New issue" button.
3. Click on the "Report a vulnerability" button. Do **NOT** use another issue type since this will be public immediately.
4. Fill in the form.
